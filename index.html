                <p>A billionaire industrialist and genius inventor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is conducting
                    weapons
                    tests overseas, but terrorists kidnap him to force him to build a devastating weapon. Instead, he

                    an armored suit and upends his captors. Returning to America, Stark refines the suit and uses it to
                    combat crime and terrorism.

                <p>It all came down to a scrum for the Infinity Stones between Thanos and Iron Man. Although Thanos
                    thought
                    he had the upper hand, Iron Man secretly took the Infinity Stones to perform a snap of his own, one
                    which wiped the Mad Titan and his army from Earth but also ended his own life.</p>
